    <p>If you are planning to make Humitas, you have to pick the right kind of corn. Humitas are made with Humero corn. Humero corn's husk is hard, and the kernels are in an irregular pattern, and when pricked, whitish milk comes out. Humero corn dries out in a matter of days, so it is important to use fresh corn when making Humitas.</p>

    <p>Time to make: Nearly 4 hours. Yield: 16 Humitas</p>

Traditionally in Chile, Humitas are cooked submerged in water (30-40 minutes), but here with the variety of corn is difficult to get the proper wrap and seal on the Humitas, and to prevent leaking is easier to steam.</td>
