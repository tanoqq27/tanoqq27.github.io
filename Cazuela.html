    <p>I am from the South of Chile, where the cold climates meet the farmlands. Where I am from, we see cold weather and we think Cazuela. Cazuela is a warm soup made with broth along with meats, veggies, corn, squash, and whatever is in reach that tastes good. To this day, I enjoy cazuela with my family very often, bringing us all back to our traditions. a good Cazuela is very convenient, quick, and easy to put together.</p>
    <p>Time to make: 45 min. Yield: 6 Cazuelas</p>
